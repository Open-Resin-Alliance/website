## 4.5 LROV - Layer Override Chunk

**Type tag:** `LROV` (`0x4C 0x52 0x4F 0x56`). Optional, multiple allowed - one chunk per
distinct delta, each named by the one or more `(layer, sector)` pairs that apply it.

**Flags:** zstd-compressed. Encrypted if `AUTH` present.

Carries the timing parameters one `(layer, sector)` pair overrides, as a JSON object under
META's field names:

```jsonc
{
  "normal_exposure_ms": 2800,
  "lift_slow_distance_um": 6000,
  "wait_time_before_cure_ms": 500
}
```

Which pairs the chunk applies to is not in the payload: each pair's layer table entry carries
`first_lrov`, either `0` (no overrides) or the directory index of the chunk holding them
([§4.7](/specs/lumen/layer-data#47-ltbl---layer-table-chunk)). Nothing else points at the chunk, so the
entries that name it are what places it - and any number of entries may name one chunk. That is
how a range is written: a delta set on 500 layers is one chunk, and the 500 entries naming it are
the range, no field in the payload saying where it starts or ends. Sharing is the encoder's choice
rather than a rule - a chunk per pair is equally conforming - and either way a reader applies the
chunk that the entry it is printing names, so a file says nothing about which form its encoder
chose beyond the directory indices themselves.

- The object carries **only** the fields that pair overrides. A field it omits keeps the
  value the pair resolves without it: the object is a sparse delta, never a replacement
  set, and there is no array of entries and no fold rule - a pair has one override set or
  none, so nothing has to decide between two of them.
- Any field META carries a value for may appear, with META's names and units: integer
  milliseconds for durations, micrometers for lengths, micrometers per minute for speeds.
  The layer counts may appear too, and they do not move the ramp: the blend uses the counts
  the pair's sector resolves before any override, so an override of `bottom_layer_count` sets
  that field's value for the pairs it is applied to and leaves the ranges where they were
  ([§8](/specs/lumen/layer-timing#8-per-layer-settings-model)).
- Overrides are applied after the sector's bottom/transition blending
  ([§8](/specs/lumen/layer-timing#8-per-layer-settings-model)), so a field an `LROV` chunk carries
  is the value the layer is printed with, whatever range it falls in.

**Reader support: REQUIRED.** Writing the chunk is the encoder's choice - a slicer may write
per-layer settings or leave them out, and a file that needs no overrides is complete without
one. Honoring it is not a choice. A conforming reader MUST apply the overrides of every
`LROV` chunk that a layer it prints points at, and a reader that does not implement overrides
MUST refuse a file in which any layer table entry carries a non-zero `first_lrov`, rather
than print that pair at the values its sector resolves to on its own.

The reason is that this is the one degradation a printer cannot notice. A layer printed at
its sector's exposure instead of its override is a print that fails quietly: the file is
structurally valid, every checksum still passes, and nothing in the output says a chunk was
ignored. So the rule is the same one [§4.12](/specs/lumen/scene-chunks#412-extd---extension-chunk)
applies to an unimplemented `critical` extension, and the same principle as
[§7.2](/specs/lumen/sectors#72-sector-0-convention-and-single-material-degradation): a capability a
reader lacks makes a file unprintable to it, not printable with approximations. A slicer
that knows its target cannot honor overrides should not write them; a printer that meets
them must.

## 4.6 PREV - Preview Image Chunk

**Type tag:** `PREV` (`0x50 0x52 0x45 0x56`). Optional, multiple allowed.

**Flags:** uncompressed (PNG is already compressed). Encryption optional.

A PNG image as raw bytes (no additional framing).

**Chunk flags:**

| Bit | Name | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| 0–3 | `preview_role` | 0 = unspecified, 1 = large (rec. 400×300), 2 = small (rec. 200×125), 3 = icon (≤64×64). Role values 4–15 are reserved. |
| 4 | `ENCRYPTED` | The common chunk flag ([§3.2](/specs/lumen/file-structure#32-chunk-descriptor)); may be set if preview confidentiality is desired. |
| 5–31 | - | Reserved. Must be 0. |

Multiple PREV chunks are permitted. Readers should select the best preview for
their display based on `preview_role`.

The role's size is a recommendation, not a constraint: a role-1 preview is "the large one",
and a reader that finds a 1024×768 image there displays it. What the role fixes is which
preview a reader with limited space or memory should reach for - the icon rather than the
large one - and no check depends on a role's pixel dimensions. A file with no preview at all
is conforming: `PREV` is for the human looking at the file, never for the print.

Beyond the role, the file ranks its previews no further: a reader that holds several of one
role picks the one it likes, and a file that carries them in a particular order is not saying
anything by that order. A host may keep a preference of its own - the reference plugin ships
`roleOrder: [1, 0, 2, 3]`, large before unspecified before small before icon - but it is the
host's preference, not a fact the file carries.
