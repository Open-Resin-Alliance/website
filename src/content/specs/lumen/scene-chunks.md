<!-- Part of the LUMEN Format Specification. Section numbers (`§3.1`) are stable anchors across the parts. -->

## 4.11 VOXL - Embedded Scene Chunk

**Type tag:** `VOXL` (`0x56 0x4F 0x58 0x4C`). Optional.

**Flags:** zstd-compressed. Encrypted if `AUTH` present.

Embeds the complete DragonFruit VOXL scene file that produced this print. This
makes the `.lumen` file a **self-contained, re-editable project** - the user
never loses the source. Any compatible slicer can extract the VOXL, restore the
full scene (models, supports, modifiers, hollowing state), and continue editing
as if the file had never been closed.

**Payload:** The raw bytes of a VOXL file (see `DragonFruit/docs/dev/voxl-format-spec.md`).
V2 binary chunk format is the current target; V1 JSON is also valid. The VOXL carries its
own internal version field for format detection.

LUMEN treats the payload as opaque. A scene is copied in on save and handed back
unchanged on re-open, so nothing in this specification requires a reader to parse VOXL
beyond recognizing which generation it is ([§11.2](/specs/lumen/validation#112-semantic-validation)).
A slicer that re-opens the file decodes the VOXL itself, under VOXL's rules, and may then
check that the scene agrees with this file's `HEAD` fields - but a printer never needs to,
and a print reader that skips the chunk entirely is conforming.

**Workflow:**

1. **Save:** DragonFruit slices a scene → writes `.lumen` with the VOXL chunk
   embedded alongside the print data. One file contains everything.
2. **Re-open:** DragonFruit opens a `.lumen` file → detects the `VOXL` chunk →
   extracts and parses the VOXL → restores the full editable scene (models,
   supports, modifiers, hollowing snapshots).
3. **Round-trip:** Edit → re-slice → overwrite `.lumen` with updated VOXL and
   new print layers. The file IS the project.
4. **Sharing:** Send one `.lumen` file. The recipient can print it (printer) or
   edit it (slicer). No separate `.voxl` sidecar.

**Design notes:**
- The VOXL chunk is optional. A `.lumen` file without it is still a valid
  printable file - it just cannot be re-edited (the source scene is missing).
- Only one `VOXL` chunk should be present. If multiple are present, readers
  should use the first one.
- The VOXL payload is zstd-compressed for storage efficiency. VOXL V2 already
  uses zlib internally; recompressing the whole file with zstd is expected to
  yield additional size reduction.
- Encrypted alongside other sensitive chunks when `AUTH` is present - scene
  geometry may be proprietary.

**Relationship to other chunks:**
- `HEAD.display_width_px` etc. should match the VOXL scene's intended printer.
- `META.materials` / `PROF.materials` should match the resin(s) used in the VOXL scene.

## 4.12 EXTD - Extension Chunk

**Type tag:** `EXTD` (`0x45 0x58 0x54 0x44`). Optional, multiple allowed.

**Flags:** compression is per-extension, and the descriptor says which way it went: an
unsealed `EXTD` whose `size_compressed` is non-zero holds a zstd frame, and one with
`size_compressed == 0` holds its extension payload as it is
([§3.2](/specs/lumen/file-structure#32-chunk-descriptor)). A sealed `EXTD` is left as stored after it
is opened, because its framing hides whether a frame is inside - and no ORA-standard extension
is compressed today, so a reader has nothing to lose by that. An extension that wants the other
convention declares it in its own specification, alongside its payload.

Vendor or future-standard extension data.

| Offset | Size | Type | Field | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | 4 | `u32` | `ext_version` | Extension format version. |
| 4 | 4 | `[u8; 4]` | `ext_type` | Four-char ASCII type code. |
| 8 | N | - | `ext_data` | Extension-specific payload. |

**Chunk flags:**

| Bit | Name | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| 0–7 | - | Reserved for standard chunk flags (bit 4 = `ENCRYPTED`, see [§3.2](/specs/lumen/file-structure#32-chunk-descriptor)). |
| 8–23 | `vendor_id` | Vendor identifier, assigned by the Alliance ([§4.12.1](#4121-vendor-id-registry)). `0x0000` = ORA standard extension. |
| 24 | `critical` | If set, a reader that does not implement this extension must refuse the file rather than print an approximation. |
| 25–31 | - | Reserved. Must be 0. |

Readers skip `EXTD` chunks they do not implement, unless `critical` is set, in which
case they MUST refuse the file ([§11.2](/specs/lumen/validation#112-semantic-validation)). An
extension with `vendor_id = 0` and one of the reserved type codes below is still
unimplemented until a reader implements its semantics; reserving the code is not the
same as defining the payload.

**Reserved ORA-standard extension types (`vendor_id = 0`):**

| `ext_type` | Name | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| `SIGN` | Signature | Cryptographic signature for file authenticity. |
| `VLYR` | Variable Layers | Per-layer height values. Reserved for a future core mechanism; not usable in v1 ([§5.8](/specs/lumen/layer-encoding#58-resin-working-curve-experimental)). |
| `CMLT` | Compression ML | Training metadata for the `ZDIC` dictionary (corpus size, training parameters). |
| `CMAP` | Color Map | Per-sector color channel mapping for multi-color printing. |

### 4.12.1 Vendor ID Registry

`vendor_id` is a 16-bit namespace the Alliance assigns, and this table is the register of it.
It is a **label, not a dispatch mechanism**: a reader acts on the `critical` bit and on the
`ext_type` it finds, and never needs this list to read a file - an extension is implemented or
it is not, and the list only settles who owns a number.

**One ID per vendor, not per product.** A vendor's extensions are told apart by `ext_type`,
which is that vendor's own namespace: `SIGN` under `0x0000` and `SIGN` under a vendor's ID are
two different extensions, and a vendor allocates its type codes however it likes, in its own
documentation. So a manufacturer with several printer lines - Concepts 3D and its Athena
printers, say - registers once and distinguishes its extensions by type.

**Assignment.** An ID is requested from the Alliance (an issue on this repository), assigned
once, and never reassigned, not even when a vendor stops using one: a file written years ago
must still name the vendor that wrote it. Registration is free and it is voluntary, and nothing
in the format depends on it - a vendor may write an ID that is not in this table, which means
only that the number is not protected and another vendor may pick the same one.

**Mnemonic IDs.** Where the space allows, an ID is assigned so that its two bytes, read in file
order, spell the vendor's mark: the value is `first_char | (second_char << 8)`, because
`vendor_id` lives at bits 8-23 and byte 1 of the flag field holds its low byte. A hex dump of
the descriptor flags then shows the mark in the field itself - `0x3343` reads `C3`, since the
bytes are `43 33` - which is what lets an unfamiliar extension be identified in a file without
opening this document. IDs that need no mnemonic, or whose two characters are taken, are
assigned in the ordinary way; only the vendor's own registration fixes which it is.

| `vendor_id` | Bytes | Vendor | Notes |
|-------------|-------|--------|-------|
| `0x0000` | - | ORA standard | Reserved for the standard extension types above; never assigned to a vendor. |
| `0x3343` | `C3` | Concepts 3D | Athena printers. Extension types are Concepts 3D's own. |
| `0xFFFF` | - | - | Reserved: not assigned, and a reader treats it as any other vendor it does not know. |

An ID that is not listed here is not an error and not a defect in the file: it belongs to a
vendor that registered after this revision was published, or to one that did not register at
all. A reader MUST NOT refuse a file over an unknown `vendor_id` - only `critical` makes a file
unprintable to a reader that does not implement the extension - and a validator MUST NOT warn
about one.
