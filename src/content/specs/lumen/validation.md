## 11. Reader Validation Requirements

Every rule below is named `<group>.<rule>`, and implementations SHOULD report the failing
rule under that name, which is also how the conformance corpus names it
([§11.6](#116-conformance-corpus)).

**Order.** A validator reports the first failure it reaches, and the lists below are in the
order it is expected to reach them: the framing (§11.1), then the semantics that need no
decompression (§11.2), then the layer data and the encryption units (§11.3, §11.4), within
each list in the order written. A file can break more than one rule - a layer table whose
first entry names no `LROV` chunk while that chunk sits unreferenced breaks two - and the
order is what decides which one is named, so a validator that reports a different violation
of the same file is not wrong about the file, only about the order. The conformance corpus
names, for each vector, the check its order reaches first; where a vector is built to break
two rules, its manifest entry says so.

This revision made a sector structural - one `LAYR` chunk and one optional `LROV` chunk per
`(layer, sector)`, addressed by the layer table - so the checks that named the old shapes are
retired, and their names must not appear in a conforming validator's report: `sect.*` and
`presence.sect` (the chunk is withdrawn);
`sector.count_match` and the other rules over the in-band sector framing, which no longer
exists; `layr.block_*` and the rules over the `layr_header` and its block table;
the `ltbl.*` rules that named a `block_index` (`ltbl.block_index_in_range`) or a block's
decompressed size (`ltbl.offsets_within_block`); the `LROV` entries-array rules
(`lrov.entry_form`, `lrov.layer_index_range`, `lrov.layer_range_order`, `lrov.sector_id_defined`),
since an `LROV` chunk names neither a layer nor a sector; `lrov.identity_consistent`, since a
sector's identity is META's and is stated once; and `ltbl.empty_layer_no_bytes`, which had no
companion field left to contradict. What replaced them is named in the lists below.

This revision also retires two names that had nothing to check: `header.chunk_count`, because
the directory is read *from* that field and so has no independent length to disagree with it
(a count that is too large fails `header.dir_offset`, and the entries are read under
`dir.descriptor`), and `layr.allocation_bound`, which the bound now shares with every other
compressed chunk as `frame.allocation_bound`.

### 11.1 Structural Validation

- [ ] Magic bytes `LUMN` at offset 0 (`header.magic`).
- [ ] Trailer magic `LEND` at `file_size - 8` (`trailer.magic`).
- [ ] Trailer CRC-32C matches `bytes[0 .. file_len-8]` (`trailer.crc32c`).
- [ ] `header.version` is recognized (`header.version`).
- [ ] `header.flags` clears the retired bits: bits 0, 2 and 4 are `0` (`header.flags_reserved`). Bits 5–31 are unassigned, and a reader MUST ignore them ([§3.1](/specs/lumen/file-structure#31-file-header)).
- [ ] `header.dir_offset` is within the file, and the whole directory fits inside it (`header.dir_offset`).
- [ ] Every chunk descriptor is readable as a 32-byte entry (`dir.descriptor`). This is where `header.chunk_count` is spent: the directory *is* that many entries read from `header.dir_offset`, so a count that runs past the end of the file fails `header.dir_offset` and the entries themselves are read here. There is no separate `header.chunk_count` check - the count has no independent source of truth to disagree with ([§11](#11-reader-validation-requirements), retired names).
- [ ] If `header.total_uncompressed_size != 0`, it equals the sum of every chunk's `size_uncompressed` (`header.total_uncompressed_size`).
- [ ] No two chunks overlap, and no chunk's stored extent lies outside the file or inside the directory (`dir.overlap`, `dir.chunk_extent`). A chunk's stored extent is `[offset, offset + size_compressed)`
  when `size_compressed > 0`, and `[offset, offset + size_uncompressed)` when
  `size_compressed == 0`. Exception: null descriptors (`offset == 0`). A `LAYR` chunk's
  extent follows the same rule: its `size_uncompressed` is the container's byte length, and a
  sealed container's is `size_compressed` ([§4.9](/specs/lumen/layer-data#49-layr---layer-data-chunk)).
- [ ] `HEAD` chunk present (`presence.head`) and the first entry in the directory (`dir.head_first`). The offset it sits at is the descriptor's business: a gap between the fixed header and the first payload is legal ([§3](/specs/lumen/file-structure#3-file-structure)), and a validator MUST NOT require `HEAD` at offset 32.
- [ ] `META` chunk present (`presence.meta`).
- [ ] `LTBL` chunk present, and exactly one (`presence.ltbl`). A second layer table is this check's failure rather than something a reader picks from: two tables can disagree about which chunk holds a layer's data and where its slice starts, and nothing in the file resolves that.
- [ ] At least one `LAYR` chunk present (`presence.layr`); each is at least 4 bytes (its
  `layr_version`) and holds exactly one frame after that field.
- [ ] `HEAD.head_version` (`head.version`), `LTBL.table_version` (`ltbl.version`), `ZDIC.zdic_version` (`zdic.version`), `AUTH.auth_version` (`auth.version`) and `META.meta_version` (`meta.version`) are recognized, and so is the `layr_version` of every `LAYR` chunk - the field is per chunk, so one unrecognized value is enough (`layr.version`).
- [ ] The `AUTH` payload is long enough for the sections it declares (`auth.frame`).
- [ ] `ZDIC`, when present, is well formed: `dict_size` does not exceed 112 640 bytes and the chunk holds that many bytes (`zdic.dict_size`), and no more than one non-null `ZDIC` chunk is present (`zdic.single`). The chunk ends where the dictionary ends: a writer MUST NOT append anything after it, and a reader MAY ignore bytes it finds there - slack inside a chunk is not a failure in either mode, because nothing is read from it.
- [ ] A dictionary is present exactly when the `LAYR` frames use one (`presence.zdic`): if any frame references a zstd dictionary (dictionary ID `!= 0`), exactly one `ZDIC` chunk is present and every frame that references a dictionary references *that* one (`layr.dict_id_match`, `zdic.dict_id_match`); if no frame references a dictionary, no `ZDIC` chunk is present and every frame's dictionary ID is `0` (`layr.dict_id_absent`). An encoder may compress one frame without the dictionary another frame uses, so a frame that reports none is not a mismatch - "the file carries a dictionary nothing uses" is this rule's own failure, reported as `presence.zdic`, and it is reported after the frames' half so a file that breaks both is named by the frames' rule.
- [ ] If `LHAS` chunk present, its payload is long enough for its header and hashes (`lhas.frame`), `hash_algorithm` is `0x01` (`lhas.hash_algorithm`), and `layer_count` equals `HEAD.total_layers` (`lhas.layer_count`). As with `ZDIC`, the chunk ends after the last leaf hash and trailing bytes are ignored rather than rejected.

### 11.2 Semantic Validation

- [ ] `HEAD.total_layers > 0` and `HEAD.total_layers == LTBL.layer_count` (`head.total_layers`, `ltbl.layer_count`).
- [ ] `LTBL.entry_size >= 28` (`ltbl.entry_size`). The entry layout is fixed through offset 28; future versions may append fields after offset 28, and readers stride by `entry_size` to skip unknown trailing fields.
- [ ] `LTBL.entry_count` equals the sum of `1 + additional_sector_count` over each layer's first entry, the table holds exactly that many entries and **ends exactly there** - a payload shorter or longer than `entry_count` entries is this check's failure, not `ltbl.entry_size` - and `additional_sector_count` is `0` on every non-first entry (`ltbl.entry_count`).
- [ ] The entries describe every layer the header declares and no other: walking the table from layer 0 reaches layer `HEAD.total_layers-1` and stops, and no entry names a layer outside that range (`ltbl.layer_index_range`).
- [ ] Within a layer, `sector_id` ascends (`ltbl.sector_ids_ascending`) and no two entries carry the same `sector_id` (`ltbl.sector_id_unique`).
- [ ] A layer's first entry is sector 0's: its `sector_id` is `0` (`ltbl.first_entry_is_sector_zero`).
- [ ] Every `LTBL` entry's `first_layr` is a directory index whose chunk is a `LAYR` chunk (`ltbl.first_layr_in_range`).
- [ ] For every `LTBL` entry, `data_offset + data_size` is at most the decompressed length of the frame that `first_layr` names (`ltbl.offset_within_chunk`).
- [ ] No two entries that name the same `LAYR` chunk describe overlapping byte ranges (`ltbl.slices_disjoint`).
- [ ] `first_lrov` is `0` or a directory index whose chunk is an `LROV` chunk (`ltbl.first_lrov_in_range`). `0` says that `(layer, sector)` has no overrides; what contradicts it is an `LROV` chunk no entry names whose payload no named chunk also carries - a set of overrides that can never be applied to anything, which is a `0` that lies (`ltbl.first_lrov_null`). A chunk that no entry names but whose payload *is* carried by a named chunk contradicts nothing: those values are applied at the pairs that name their twin, so that file is the orphan case, not this one.
- [ ] Every `LROV` chunk is named by at least one entry (`lrov.orphan`): the entry that names a chunk is the only thing that places it, so a chunk no entry names holds overrides nothing applies. Two or more entries naming one chunk is legal - that is one delta covering all of them - and is not this check's failure.
- [ ] The `MULTI_SECTOR` flag (header bit 1) is set exactly when some layer carries more than one sector (`head.multi_sector_flag`).
- [ ] `HEAD.layer_height_um > 0` (`head.layer_height`).
- [ ] `HEAD.build_width_um > 0`, `HEAD.build_depth_um > 0`, `HEAD.build_height_um > 0` (`head.build_dims`).
- [ ] `HEAD.encoder_name_len <= 256`, and `HEAD.size_uncompressed == 44 + encoder_name_len` (`head.frame`): the fixed fields before and after the name total 44 bytes, so a v1 `HEAD` chunk is exactly `44 + encoder_name_len` bytes and there is no room in it for a field this revision does not define.
- [ ] `HEAD.display_width_px × display_height_px > 0` (`head.display_pixels`).
- [ ] The META payload is a JSON object (`meta.json`).
- [ ] META JSON contains all required fields (`meta.required_fields`): `meta_version`, `normal_exposure_ms`, `bottom_exposure_ms`, `bottom_layer_count`, `transition_layer_count`, `layer_height_um`, `lift_slow_distance_um`, `lift_slow_speed_um_min`, `retract_fast_distance_um`, `retract_fast_speed_um_min`.
- [ ] Every `*_ms` field in META, and `estimated_print_time_sec`, is a JSON integer (`meta.time_integer`). A value with a fractional part such as `2500.5` is invalid; the rule covers the timing fields of META's `sectors` entries too, since they are META's fields. See [§4.2](/specs/lumen/meta#42-meta---metadata-chunk) for the encoders' and readers' obligations.
- [ ] Every `light_pwm` and `bottom_light_pwm` - in META, in a `META.sectors` entry, in an `LROV` payload and in a `PROF`'s `settings` - is within `0..=255` (`pwm.range`, [§4.2](/specs/lumen/meta#42-meta---metadata-chunk)). A duty outside that range is a slicer that has mistaken a percentage or a wider scale for the field, and a reader never clamps it: the two readings print at different powers.
- [ ] `META.normal_exposure_ms > 0` and `META.bottom_exposure_ms > 0`, as integer comparisons (`meta.exposure`).
- [ ] `META.layer_height_um > 0` (`meta.layer_height`).
- [ ] If `META.materials` is present, it is a non-empty array and every entry has a non-empty `name` (`meta.materials_shape`).
- [ ] `META.sectors`, when present, is an array of JSON objects, each carrying an integer `sector_id >= 1`, unique across the array (`meta.sectors_shape`).
- [ ] If `META.sectors[i].material_index` is present, `META.materials` exists, is non-empty and contains that index (`meta.sector_material_index`).
- [ ] If `META.cure_curve` present, `dp_um > 0`, `ec_mj_cm2 > 0.0`, `e0_mj_cm2 >= 0.0` (`meta.cure_curve`).
- [ ] If `META.chamber_temperature_c` or `vat_temperature_c` present, values are in range `[0.0, 120.0]` (`meta.temperature_range`).
- [ ] `AUTH` is present exactly when the `ENCRYPTED` flag is set (`presence.auth`), and its cipher is recognized (`auth.cipher_known`).
- [ ] Each `LROV` payload is a JSON object (`lrov.json`).
- [ ] Every `*_ms` field in an `LROV` payload is a JSON integer (`lrov.time_integer`).
- [ ] If `PROF` chunk present, `profile_name` and `profile_version` are non-empty strings (`prof.profile_identity`).
- [ ] If `PROF` chunk present, `profile_type` is one of `"material"`, `"printer"`, `"combined"` (`prof.profile_type`).
- [ ] If `PROF` chunk present, `settings.normal_exposure_ms > 0` and `settings.bottom_exposure_ms > 0`, as integer comparisons (`prof.settings_exposure`).
- [ ] Every `*_ms` field in `PROF.settings` is a JSON integer (`prof.settings_time_integer`).
- [ ] If `PROF` chunk present, `settings.layer_height_um > 0` (`prof.settings_layer_height`).
- [ ] If `PROF.settings.cure_curve` present, `dp_um > 0`, `ec_mj_cm2 > 0.0`, `e0_mj_cm2 >= 0.0` (`prof.cure_curve`).
- [ ] If `PROF` chunk present with `profile_uuid`, the UUID string is well-formed (36 characters, 8-4-4-4-12 hex pattern, `prof.profile_uuid`).
- [ ] If `PROF.materials` is present, it satisfies the same shape rules as `META.materials` (`prof.materials_shape`).
- [ ] If `PREV` chunk present, `preview_role` is 0–3 and reserved flag bits 5–31 are 0 (`prev.flags`, [§4.6](/specs/lumen/print-control#46-prev---preview-image-chunk)).
- [ ] (Strict mode) If `PREV` chunk present, its payload begins with the PNG signature and its `IHDR` is well-formed (`prev.png_signature`, [§4.6](/specs/lumen/print-control#46-prev---preview-image-chunk)).
- [ ] If `LHAS` chunk present, recompute Merkle root from `layer_hashes` and verify it matches `merkle_root` (`lhas.root_recompute`).
- [ ] (Strict mode) If `LHAS` chunk present, decompress and hash each layer; verify against `layer_hashes` (`lhas.leaf_match`).
- [ ] (Strict mode) If `VOXL` chunk present, the payload is recognizable as VOXL: it begins with the V2 magic `VOXL` or with the V1 JSON document marker `{` (`voxl.signature`) ([§4.11](/specs/lumen/scene-chunks#411-voxl---embedded-scene-chunk)). Whether it is a *valid* VOXL file is VOXL's business, checked by whatever parses the scene; a print reader never needs to know.
- [ ] Every `EXTD` payload is at least 8 bytes: `ext_version` and `ext_type` make up the fixed part of the frame (`extd.frame`, [§4.12](/specs/lumen/scene-chunks#412-extd---extension-chunk)).
- [ ] `EXTD` `ext_type` is four ASCII characters (`extd.ext_type`).
- [ ] `EXTD` reserved flag bits - 0-3, 5-7 and 25-31 - are 0 (`extd.flags`, [§4.12](/specs/lumen/scene-chunks#412-extd---extension-chunk)).
- [ ] No `EXTD` chunk that a reader does not implement carries `critical = 1` (`extd.critical`): such a file is unprintable to that reader rather than printable with approximations ([§4.12](/specs/lumen/scene-chunks#412-extd---extension-chunk)).

### 11.3 Layer Data Validation (post-decompression)

- [ ] Before decompressing, a `LAYR` frame declares its content size (`layr.content_size_present`). The descriptor does not carry the frame's output length, so a frame without one is rejected rather than allocated for ([§4.9](/specs/lumen/layer-data#49-layr---layer-data-chunk)).
- [ ] No frame is decompressed without a bound on what it may expand to (`frame.allocation_bound`). A `LAYR` frame's declared content size is at most what the chunk's slices justify - grayscale REE costs at most about 5 bytes per pixel plus framing per slice - and every other compressed chunk's frame is at most 4096 times its stored length, so a corrupt or hostile file cannot force an unbounded allocation. The non-`LAYR` bound is a guard rather than a property of the data: a legitimate `META`, `PROF`, `LROV` or `VOXL` payload of mostly one repeated byte can exceed it, which is why it is generous, and a file that trips it is refused rather than sized for.
- [ ] Decompressing a `LAYR` frame succeeds and yields exactly the size the frame declares, and no more (`layr.frame_decompressed_size`).
- [ ] A frame's zstd dictionary ID equals `ZDIC.dict_id` when `ZDIC` is present (`layr.dict_id_match`, `zdic.dict_id_match`), and is `0` when it is absent (`layr.dict_id_absent`).
- [ ] For each `LTBL` entry: `data_offset + data_size` is within the decompressed output of the chunk `first_layr` names (`ltbl.offset_within_chunk`), and entries naming one chunk do not overlap (`ltbl.slices_disjoint`).
- [ ] All varints are well-formed: minimally encoded (no overlong forms), terminated within the containing buffer, and at most 10 bytes (the maximum for a 64-bit value, `ree.varint`).
- [ ] Layer encoding tag is in `{0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03}` (`ree.tag`). Reject any layer with an unknown tag.
- [ ] Split-encoded layers (tag `0x02`): `aa_positions` values are strictly increasing and every position is `< total_pixels` (`ree.split_positions`), and `aa_values` holds exactly `aa_pixel_count` bytes.
- [ ] Attached-encoded layers (tag `0x03`): every escape position is strictly increasing, is `< total_pixels`, and lies strictly inside the core run it attaches to - its offset in that run is neither `0` nor the run's last pixel (`ree.attach_positions`).
- [ ] Attached-encoded layers (tag `0x03`): `aa_pixel_count` equals the number of overlay pixels the attachment bits and the escapes describe, `escape_count` does not exceed it, and every stored overlay value is a byte (`ree.attach_count`).
- [ ] (Strict mode) Attached-encoded layers (tag `0x03`): no attachment bit addresses a run at or past `run_count`, no run of one pixel sets both of its bits, and the bits past the last run are clear (`ree.attach_bits`).
- [ ] (Strict mode) Attached-encoded layers (tag `0x03`): every overlay value is neither `0x00` nor `0xFF` and thresholds (`v >= 128`) to the value of the core run it sits in (`ree.attach_threshold`).
- [ ] For binary REE (tag `0x00`) and attached REE (tag `0x03`): `first_value` must be `0x00` or `0xFF` (`ree.first_value`).
- [ ] REE streams decode to strictly increasing end positions, and the last end position equals `total_pixels` (`ree.end_positions`).
- [ ] (Strict mode) Significance planes ([§5.3.1](/specs/lumen/layer-encoding#531-significance-planes)): a stream's four plane lengths describe planes that are prefix-closed - a non-empty plane may not follow an empty one - and the fixed bytes, the plane lengths and the planes account for exactly `data_size` (`ree.planes`, `ree.no_trailing_bytes`).
- [ ] A slice's stored bytes and its `data_size` agree: the stream at `data_offset` consumes exactly `data_size` bytes with nothing left over (`ree.data_size`, `ree.no_trailing_bytes`), and a slice with `data_size == 0` carries no stream at all - it is an all-black `(layer, sector)` ([§5.7](/specs/lumen/layer-encoding#57-canonical-encoding)).
- [ ] (Strict mode) No slice uses the non-canonical `run_count == 0` form (`ree.no_run_count_zero`); an all-black slice is stored with `data_size == 0` and no bytes ([§5.3](/specs/lumen/layer-encoding#53-binary-ree-no-anti-aliasing)).
- [ ] (Strict mode) Binary REE (tag `0x00`): every stored run length is `>= 1`, the implicit final run length is `>= 1`, and the lengths sum to exactly `total_pixels` (`ree.run_lengths`).
- [ ] (Strict mode) Grayscale REE (tag `0x01`): every run length is `>= 1` and no two adjacent runs carry the same value (`ree.grayscale_runs`).
- [ ] (Strict mode) A slice whose pixels are all `0x00`/`0xFF` is not stored as grayscale REE; it uses tag `0x00` (`ree.grayscale_all_binary`).
- [ ] (Strict mode) The same tag choice for split REE: a slice whose pixels are all `0x00`/`0xFF` has no anti-aliasing to overlay, so it is not stored as tag `0x02` - an empty overlay over a thresholded core is a stream a strict validator rejects (`ree.split_all_binary`).
- [ ] (Strict mode) Split REE (tag `0x02`): the binary component thresholds at `v >= 128`, and the overlay covers exactly the pixels whose value is neither `0x00` nor `0xFF` (`ree.split_threshold`).
- [ ] (Strict mode) The sector masks of one layer are pairwise disjoint: no pixel is exposed by two sectors of the same layer (`sector.partition`). Two sectors of a layer live in different `LAYR` chunks, so this compares the slices the layer's entries name ([§7.3](/specs/lumen/sectors#73-sector-mask-invariant)). What the masks together *cover* is not this check's business and cannot be: the file does not carry the geometry the masks came from.

### 11.4 Encryption Validation

- [ ] If `ENCRYPTED` flag set, all `LAYR`/`META`/`PROF`/`LROV`/`VOXL`/`ZDIC` chunks have the encrypted flag set (`crypt.chunk_flags`), every `LAYR` frame is at least 28 bytes (one sealed unit), and every `LAYR` frame is individually sealed ([§9.3](/specs/lumen/encryption#93-encryption-format)).
- [ ] If `ENCRYPTED` flag set, `HEAD`, `AUTH`, `LTBL` and `LHAS` do **not** have the encrypted flag set - they are the plaintext spine a reader uses before it has a key - and a `LAYR` chunk's 4-byte version field is plaintext inside its sealed chunk ([§9.1](/specs/lumen/encryption#91-design-principles)). `PREV` and `EXTD` may be sealed or not; both are conforming.
- [ ] If the `ENCRYPTED` flag is clear, no chunk descriptor sets the encrypted bit: there is no key in the file that could open such a chunk (`crypt.no_key`, [§9.1](/specs/lumen/encryption#91-design-principles)).
- [ ] Each sealed unit opens with `associated_data = chunk_type || 0x00 || unit_index_le_u32`, where `unit_index` is `0` for a single-unit chunk and the `LAYR` chunk's directory index for a `LAYR` chunk (`crypt.unit_index_binding`). A sealed frame presented at another `LAYR` chunk's directory index therefore fails its tag check: an implementation that opens it anyway has not bound the unit to its identity.
- [ ] Auth tag verifies for each encrypted chunk (decryption integrity check, `crypt.tag_verify`).
- [ ] `AUTH.mode` has at least one bit set (`crypt.mode_empty`).
- [ ] If `AUTH.mode` bit 0 is set, `password_section_len >= 65` (the fixed password section size, `crypt.password_section_len`; see [§4.4.1](/specs/lumen/chunk-auth#441-password-section)).
- [ ] If `AUTH.mode` bit 1 is set, `machine_section_len >= 104` and `machine_section_len % 104 == 0` (must contain at least one complete recipient entry, `crypt.machine_section_len`; see [§4.4.2](/specs/lumen/chunk-auth#442-machine-binding-section)).
- [ ] Machine-binding entries are well formed (`crypt.recipient_entry`), and an exchange that yields the all-zero shared secret is rejected rather than used as a KEK (`crypt.low_order_point`, [§4.4.2](/specs/lumen/chunk-auth#442-machine-binding-section)).
- [ ] A wrapped session key that does not unwrap is reported as an unwrap failure (`crypt.key_unwrap`), and a file whose key cannot be recovered - wrong password, or no recipient entry matching this machine - is refused rather than partially decrypted (`crypt.no_key`).
- [ ] Argon2id parameters are within the reader's supported budget (`crypt.argon2_budget`). Readers MUST reject a file whose derivation cost exceeds that budget rather than attempting it - a hostile file can otherwise exhaust memory. Recommended ceilings: `iterations <= 10`, `memory_kib <= 4 194 304`, `parallelism <= 16`.

### 11.5 Validation Levels

- **Loose** (default for printing): Accept structurally valid files. Skip unknown
  chunks and fields - ones this revision does not define, or that the reader has no use
  for, such as `PREV`, `PROF` or `LHAS`. Skipping never reaches a chunk the reader must act
  on: an `LROV` chunk a reader cannot honor makes the file unprintable to it, not printable
  without overrides ([§4.5](/specs/lumen/print-control#45-lrov---layer-override-chunk)).
- **Strict** (file verification tools): Enforce all semantic validations. Warn on
  non-critical issues, error on critical ones.

Checks marked *strict mode* above MUST NOT fail a loose-mode read: a loose reader
accepts them, a strict validator rejects them.

The duration integer checks (`meta.time_integer`, `prof.settings_time_integer`,
`lrov.time_integer`) and the PWM range check (`pwm.range`) are not strict-only. A duration with a
fractional part, and a duty outside `0..=255`, are type violations rather than
canonicalization preferences, so a loose reader rejects them too. They cover every duration in the timing namespace - META's `sectors`
entries are META's fields, so `meta.time_integer` covers them - and `meta.time_integer`
also covers META's `estimated_print_time_sec`, which is whole seconds rather than
milliseconds ([§4.2](/specs/lumen/meta#42-meta---metadata-chunk)). Whether a reader
*additionally* rejects integral floating-point syntax such as `2500.0` is the reader's
choice, and no file may rely on either answer.

### 11.6 Conformance Corpus

The repository carries byte-exact test vectors and an independent validator under
[`../test-vectors/`](../test-vectors/). Implementations SHOULD validate against them. Each
valid vector pins the uncompressed structures it contains exactly - the file header,
`HEAD`, `META` with its `sectors` entries, `AUTH`, `LTBL`, every `LAYR` chunk's
`layr_version` and the decompressed output of its frame, `LHAS`, every REE stream, the
chunk directory and the trailer - and each invalid vector fails the check its manifest entry
names, which is the first one the order of [§11](#11-reader-validation-requirements) reaches
in that file. A file that breaks two rules has one failure named, and the vector's manifest
entry says which and why. Each valid vector also records the settings a conforming reader must
resolve for a sample of `(layer, sector)` points, which pins the [§8](/specs/lumen/layer-timing#8-per-layer-settings-model)
pipeline - base values, bottom and transition blending, absent-field defaults, and the
`LROV` overrides a reader is required to apply ([§4.5](/specs/lumen/print-control#45-lrov---layer-override-chunk)) -
rather than only the bytes. Compressed payloads are pinned by property - the manifest records
the zstd version and level, each frame's dictionary ID and its declared content size, and a
validator asserts those rather than re-deriving bytes - while the vector's own SHA-256 pins
the whole file as committed, frames included, for the zstd version that built it. The
encrypted vectors carry their test password and recipient key in the manifest.

Coverage is not exhaustive. The corpus exercises single- and multi-sector layer data,
the empty-slice form, all four encoding tags, dictionary compression, files with more
than one `LAYR` chunk, both encryption modes and both ciphers, and every chunk type this
specification defines. The `LAYR` unit-index binding is exercised by such a file: two
`LAYR` chunks whose sealed frames are interchangeable in shape, so moving one to the other
chunk's directory index is a failure rather than an accepted file. Two things are pinned at
the transport level only: the `VOXL` payload is byte-exact while VOXL's own validation stays
outside this specification, and `EXTD` covers the frame and the flag semantics while
individual extension payloads remain vendor-defined and are not pinned. See
`test-vectors/README.md` for the check-name convention and the full scope.
