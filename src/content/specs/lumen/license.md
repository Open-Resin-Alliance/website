## Format Governance

The Open Resin Alliance serves as the steward of the LUMEN format. This is an
ecosystem coordination role, not a legal restriction - the Specification is
licensed under MIT and may be freely implemented, extended, and forked.

To protect interoperability across implementations:

- The Alliance maintains the canonical version of this Specification.
- Vendor IDs for `EXTD` chunks are registered through the Alliance to prevent
  collisions between independent implementations. Vendor ID `0x0000` is
  reserved for extensions standardized as part of the core specification.
- Format version numbers are ratified by the Alliance to ensure a single,
  coherent version lineage.

These conventions are voluntary. Implementers who wish to interoperate
smoothly within the LUMEN ecosystem are encouraged to coordinate through the
Alliance, but they are under no legal obligation to do so.
