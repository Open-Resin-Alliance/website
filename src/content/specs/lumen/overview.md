<!-- Part of the LUMEN Format Specification. Section numbers (`§3.1`) are stable anchors across the parts. -->

## Abstract

The LUMEN format is a next-generation, open-source print file format for resin
(MSLA) 3D printing, developed as part of the Open Resin Alliance ecosystem. It is
designed to complement the existing ORA infrastructure - serving as the native
output format for the **DragonFruit** slicer and the primary print format
consumed by **Odyssey** firmware (via its **Orion** frontend).

Existing container formats (CTB, GOO, AFZ, NanoDLP) were reverse-engineered from
proprietary ecosystems. They carry the legacy of fixed binary layouts, run-length-only
compression, obfuscated layer encoding, and fixed limits on resolution and layer
count. LUMEN breaks from this lineage entirely. It is designed from first principles,
without proprietary baggage and without constraints kept for legacy compatibility.

This document is the normative specification for LUMEN v1.0. It defines every
byte on disk, every semantic invariant, and every validation rule a conforming
reader or writer must observe.

### Reader's Guide

This document is written for two audiences, and structured so each can find
what they need without reading the whole thing:

| Audience | Recommended path |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Engineers evaluating LUMEN** (product managers, engineering leads, curious hackers) | Read [§1](#1-design-philosophy) (Design Philosophy), [§2](#2-core-conventions) (Core Conventions), the [§4](/specs/lumen/chunks#4-chunk-types) chunk summary table, [§5](/specs/lumen/layer-encoding#5-layer-mask-encoding) intro, [§6](/specs/lumen/compression#6-compression-strategy) intro, [§9](/specs/lumen/encryption#9-encryption-model) intro, and [§12](/specs/lumen/comparison#12-comparison-with-existing-formats) (Comparison). Skip binary layout tables unless you need them. |
| **Developers implementing LUMEN** (encoder/decoder authors, firmware engineers) | Read everything. Start with [§3](/specs/lumen/file-structure#3-file-structure) (File Structure) and [§4](/specs/lumen/chunks#4-chunk-types) (Chunk Types) for the container, then [§5](/specs/lumen/layer-encoding#5-layer-mask-encoding) (Layer Mask Encoding) for the REE spec. Reference [§11](/specs/lumen/validation#11-reader-validation-requirements) (Validation) for your test plan. |

Sections marked with implementation-level binary tables assume the reader is
writing code against the format. Sections with broader prose and design
rationale are written for a general engineering audience.

## 1. Design Philosophy

LUMEN is built on six principles that reflect the values of the Open Resin
Alliance:

1. **Compression efficiency first.** Modern 8K–12K printers produce 30–75
   megapixel layers. A 2,000-layer print at 12K resolution represents
   approximately 150 GB of raw pixel data before compression. LUMEN combines
   Run-End Encoding (REE), zstd cross-layer dictionary compression, and a novel
   split encoding strategy for anti-aliased prints to push compressed file sizes
   far below what run-length-only formats achieve.

2. **Human-inspectable metadata.** Print parameters, material definitions,
   per-layer overrides, and machine metadata are stored as structured JSON.
   A user can inspect these with standard tools. Binary encoding is reserved
   exclusively for layer masks and previews where it provides unambiguous value.

3. **Extensible by design.** A chunk-based container with typed sections ensures
   the format can grow without breaking existing readers. Unknown chunks are
   skipped. Known chunks carry version sub-fields so a future v2 reader can
   still parse v1 data without modification.

4. **Multi-material from the ground up.** Sectors (exposure groups) are a
   first-class concept, not an afterthought. Each layer can carry multiple
   independent masks, each with its own exposure and motion profile and, opting in,
   its own resin - ready for multi-vat hardware. A sector carries no material
   by default, so a single-material printer reads one sector and is not asked to
   understand the rest.

5. **Per-layer settings.** Any timing parameter can be overridden for any layer
   or range of layers - and per sector, since two sectors of one layer are separate
   exposures. The bottom, transition and normal ranges still describe the
   common case ([§8](/specs/lumen/layer-timing#8-per-layer-settings-model)); the overrides extend
   that model rather than replacing it.

6. **Open and transparent.** No obfuscation and no mandatory encryption. Optional
   authenticated encryption is available for secure facilities that require
   confidentiality, and its use is the file author's choice.

### 1.1 What LUMEN Is Not

To avoid confusion with other parts of the ORA ecosystem, LUMEN is explicitly
**not**:

- **Not a scene format.** LUMEN carries resolved print data (layer masks,
  exposure settings, motion parameters). For editable 3D scenes with models,
  supports, and modifiers, see the VOXL format. LUMEN can *embed* a VOXL scene
  ([§4.11](/specs/lumen/scene-chunks#411-voxl---embedded-scene-chunk)) for round-trip editing, but the format's primary purpose is print
  execution.

- **Not a streaming protocol.** LUMEN is a file format, designed for storage
  and transfer as a complete unit. It is not intended for real-time printer
  control over a network.

- **Not a printer-specific format.** LUMEN is printer-agnostic. It carries
  display dimensions and timing parameters that any compatible firmware can
  interpret. Printer-specific calibration data belongs in the firmware, not
  in the print file.

- **Not a drop-in replacement.** LUMEN requires firmware that implements it.
  Printers that do not still need CTB, GOO, or another format they support.

## 2. Core Conventions

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Extension | `.lumen` |
| Media type | `application/vnd.openresin.lumen` (vendor tree) |
| Magic bytes | `LUMN` (`0x4C 0x55 0x4D 0x4E`) |
| Endianness | Little-endian (all multi-byte integers) |
| Coordinate basis | Right-handed, Z-up |
| Image orientation | Layer masks are stored as the printer must expose them; readers apply no flip ([§4.1](/specs/lumen/head#41-head---file-header-chunk)). |
| Units | Micrometers (`um`), micrometers per minute (`um/min`) and milliseconds (`ms`); seconds (`s`) only for the Unix timestamp and the estimated print time. Lengths, speeds and durations are whole numbers. |
| Range notation | `a..b` is half-open `[a, b)`. `for i in 0..N` iterates `i = 0, 1, ..., N-1`. |

Format detection: a `.lumen` file begins with the four ASCII bytes `LUMN`.

### 2.1 Requirement Keywords

The words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **MAY** and
**OPTIONAL** are used in the sense of [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119),
and a requirement's force does not depend on how it is capitalized: where this document
writes "a reader must reject" or "an encoder should prefer", the obligation is the same one
the keyword in capitals would carry, because the alternative - a reader deciding which
sentences are load-bearing from their typography - is exactly the ambiguity a specification
exists to remove.

- **MUST**: a hard requirement. An implementation that does not meet it is not conforming,
  and a file whose bytes depend on it being met is not a conforming file.
- **SHOULD**: a recommendation. An implementation may deviate, but the reason it deviates
  is worth writing down, and a reader that finds one behaviour where this document describes
  another has found a bug before it has found a freedom.
- **MAY**: a genuine choice, where two conforming implementations legitimately differ. Where
  a `MAY` sits on the writer's side, the file says which way it went - a chunk is present or
  not, a flag is set or not - so a reader never has to guess which choice was made.

Rules that carry no keyword are descriptions of the format rather than obligations on an
implementation: field layouts, worked examples, and the rationale in the design notes. Where
a rule's force matters, it carries a keyword or is listed as a check in
[§11](/specs/lumen/validation#11-reader-validation-requirements), which is the complete set of
things a validator is expected to enforce.
