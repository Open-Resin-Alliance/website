**Motion model.** Lift and retract are each performed in two segments, and a
`*_distance*` field is the length of one segment, not a total:

| Segment | Distance | Speed |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Lift, slow - the peel, to break the layer away from the film | `lift_slow_distance_um` | `lift_slow_speed_um_min` |
| Lift, fast - the remainder of the lift | `lift_fast_distance_um` | `lift_fast_speed_um_min` |
| Retract, fast - most of the return | `retract_fast_distance_um` | `retract_fast_speed_um_min` |
| Retract, slow - the final approach | `retract_slow_distance_um` | `retract_slow_speed_um_min` |

A lift runs its slow segment first and its fast segment second; a retract runs its fast
segment first and its slow segment second. The name says which segment it is, so the order
of execution is never in doubt, and it is the same fact in both directions - which is why
the fields are named for the role rather than numbered, since the first segment of a lift
is the slow one and the first segment of a retract is the fast one.

The name does not constrain the speeds: an encoder may set either segment faster than the
other, and a validator must not require that the slow segment is the slower of the two. The
name describes the part the segment plays in the move, not a comparison.

The total travel of a move is the sum of its two segments. A segment whose distance or speed
is `0` is not performed, so a single-stage move is the degenerate case: a single-stage lift
sets `lift_fast_distance_um` to `0`, and a single-stage retract sets `retract_slow_distance_um`
to `0`. The `bottom_*` fields follow the same model.

**Field resolution for readers:**

1. Start with META's values as defaults for all layers. For a sector `>= 1`, its entry in `META.sectors` replaces META's value for every field it carries, so a sector resolves field by field; a sector with no entry, sector 0 included, resolves from META alone.
2. Apply bottom/transition blending over the ranges that sector resolves with: layers in its bottom range use bottom-prefixed values; layers in its transition range interpolate between bottom and normal values ([§8](/specs/lumen/layer-timing#8-per-layer-settings-model) defines the formula and which fields participate).
3. If the `(layer, sector)` pair's layer table entry carries a non-zero `first_lrov`, apply the fields that `LROV` chunk holds ([§4.5](/specs/lumen/print-control#45-lrov---layer-override-chunk)).
4. **Absent fields.** A field META does not carry, that the sector's `META.sectors` entry does not supply for the sector and that the pair's `LROV` chunk does not override, resolves to `0` for a distance, speed or duration - a segment or a pause that is not performed - and to `255` for `light_pwm`. Absent does not mean "whatever the implementation usually does": two readers must resolve the same file to the same numbers, so an encoder that leaves a field out is asking for zero. A field with no meaning to zero is not in this class, and is absent rather than zero when META does not carry it: `chamber_temperature_c` and `vat_temperature_c` are targets the printer uses or does not, and the `cure_curve` is either present or not.

See [§8](/specs/lumen/layer-timing#8-per-layer-settings-model) for the complete layer timing pipeline.

**Materials:** `materials` is the authoritative material library for this print.
`META.sectors[].material_index` indexes it and defaults to `0`. A single-material print carries
a one-element array and sector 0 uses element 0. If `materials` is absent, material
identity is unknown and consumers fall back to their own default.

**Sectors:** `sectors` is optional. An entry carries the base timing for one sector `>= 1` and
whatever identity that sector has; sector 0 has no entry, and a sector that has no entry
resolves from META alone with no material of its own - which is the default, since a sector
carries no material unless `material_index` says it does. Each entry is a JSON object with a
required `sector_id` (`>= 1`, unique among the entries); a file MUST NOT carry two entries
with the same `sector_id`. Every timing field is optional and inherited per field, and that
covers the layer counts like any other timing field: an entry may carry `bottom_layer_count`
and `transition_layer_count` of its own, and one that does is blended over **its own** bottom
and transition ranges. Its bottom range can be longer than META's, its transition steps land
on different layers, and two sectors in one file can disagree about where the bottom range
ends - which is the point, since a support material and a model resin rarely want the same
one ([§8](/specs/lumen/layer-timing#8-per-layer-settings-model)). When `material_index` is present
the referenced `materials` array MUST exist, be non-empty and contain that index. `color_rgba`
is a display hint that overrides the referenced material's color for this sector; it does not
affect exposure.

Lengths are integer micrometers, speeds integer micrometers per minute, and durations
integer milliseconds, so a reader compares them exactly instead of within a tolerance. The
one duration not in milliseconds is META's `estimated_print_time_sec`, an informational
estimate reported in whole seconds: a print that runs for hours is not known to the
millisecond, and reporting one would claim a precision nothing in the format supports. An
encoder holding a finer value rounds to the nearest unit; nothing below one unit is
expressible, and no field carries a fractional micrometer, millisecond or second. The
remaining numeric fields - energy densities, temperatures, percentages and densities - are
ordinary JSON numbers, and readers must accept both integer and floating-point syntax for
those. Readers must ignore unknown JSON keys.

Durations are whole numbers, and there are no exceptions to that: every `*_ms` field holds
an integer number of milliseconds and `estimated_print_time_sec` an integer number of
seconds. A value with a fractional part (`2500.5`, or `14400.5` for an estimate) is
invalid, and an encoder MUST write integer syntax. A reader MAY additionally reject
integral floating-point syntax such as `2500.0`; a file MUST NOT depend on which of the two
a reader does, so no file may carry `2500.0` where `2500` is meant.
