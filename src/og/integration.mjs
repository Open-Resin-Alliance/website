/**
 * Renders a social card for every page, after the site is built.
 *
 * Deliberately downstream of the pages rather than a route of its own: the card for
 * a page is built from that page's own <title>, description and card meta, so a new
 * blog post or specification gets a card the moment it gets a page, with nothing to
 * register and nothing to keep in step. A route endpoint would need its own list of
 * slugs, and a list that disagrees with the pages fails silently as a 404 image.
 *
 * The paths line up with `ogImagePath()` in src/lib/og.ts, which is what the pages
 * put in their markup: `/blog/foo/` is `/og/blog/foo.png` either way.
